            	<p id="lead-in">Twin Finch is an authentic micro-roastery; small, dedicated, and highly focused on quality. We have a constantly evolving, hand picked selection of fine coffee origins and delicious blends engineered to help you brew a cafe-quality cup at home.</p>
                <p>Our coffee is roasted in a hot air, refractory lined roaster with an extraordinary level of control. The significance of relying on a high volume of hot air to roast coffee beans can’t be understated. Most small coffee roasters use a single stage burner which offers virtually no control during the roasting process. The refractory significantly reduces hot spots which can damage coffee beans and produces a much more even roasting environment.</p>

            <div class="col-1-1">
            	<p>Online orders usually ship quickly and arrive within three business days. We only ship the freshest coffee and your satifaction is guaranteed. Our rotating, featured coffees are roasted on a more limited basis and your order may be held until the next time a batch hits the roaster. We only ship whole bean, but will grind for you in-store per request.</p>
                <p>You can buy from us directly at our Seattle storefront located at 457 NW Market Street.</p>
